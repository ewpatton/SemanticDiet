SemanticDiet is an effort to provide structure for representing nutrition, recipes, and dietary information on the web. It relies on industry standards such as the Extensible Markup Language (XML), the Resource Description Framework (RDF), and the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to encode the relationships between entities. All of the source is made available as Free and Open Source Software, and data published at semanticdiet.com are available under the Creative Commons Zero (CC Zero) license.
